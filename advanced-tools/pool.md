The Pool install script for the RaspiBlitz is [in this PR](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz/pull/1739):

```text
# download
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openoms/raspiblitz/pool/home.admin/config.scripts/bonus.pool.sh
# inspect the script
cat bonus.pool.sh
# install
bash bonus.pool.sh on
```

## clearing\_price\_rate

The uniform clearing price rate in parts per billion of the batch. It equals to the lowest included bid rate in the batch.

## ratings

Returns the current Node Tier of a node, along with other information.

By default nodes listed in the [Bos Score list](bosscore.md) are used to fill the bids, called `TIER_1` in the ratings. They are shortlisted according to: up time, inbound capacity, history, channel updates, ability to actively route \(via probing\).

* Check for a rating of a public node:

  ```text
    pool auction ratings [NODE_PUBKEY]
  ```

* The check the rating of the local node:

  ```text
    $ pool auc r $(lncli getinfo|grep "identity"|cut -d'"' -f4)
    {
        "node_ratings": [
            {
                "node_pubkey": "REDACTED_NODE_PUBKEY",
                "node_tier": "TIER_1"
            }
        ]
    }
  ```

* A channel buyer \(Taker\) can specify a bid to accept all tiers with `--min_node_tier 0`

  ```text
   --min_node_tier value          the min node tier this bid should be matched with, tier 1 nodes are considered 'good', if set to tier 0, then all nodes will be considered regardless of 'quality' (default: 0)
  ```

## nextbatchinfo

Returns information about the next batch the auctioneer will perform.

Shows:

* `fee_rate_sat_per_kw`: what the target fee rate cut off will be
* `clear_timestamp`: the blockheight of the next marker clearing attempt

`$ pool auction nextbatchinfo`

Example:

```text
{
    "conf_target": 35,
    "fee_rate_sat_per_kw": "27714",
    "clear_timestamp": "1604406782"
}
```

For your order to be included in the next batch the `fee_rate_sat_per_kw` should be above the cut off value.

List the `fee_rate_sat_per_kw` of your orders with:

```text
$ pool orders list | grep fee_rate_sat_per_kw
```

## auction snapshot

Returns information about a prior batch such as the clearing price and the set of orders included in the batch. The prev\_batch\_id field can be used to explore prior batches in the sequence, similar to a block chain.

last batch info:  
`$ pool auction snapshot`

query the prior batches recursively:

```text
# get the previous batch id
prev_batch_id=$(pool auc s |jq -r '.prev_batch_id')

# show the prior batch (just repeat the line to show the past batches)
prev_batch_id=$(pool auc s --batch_id $prev_batch_id|jq -r '.prev_batch_id') && pool auc s --batch_id $prev_batch_id

# show only the clearing price of the prior batch recursively:
prev_batch_id=$(pool auc s --batch_id $prev_batch_id|jq -r '.prev_batch_id') && pool auc s --batch_id $prev_batch_id|jq -r '.clearing_price_rate'
```

Search the txid of a batch on [http://1ml.com](http://1ml.com) after it is confirmed \(channels opened and published\) to see the details of the channels and peers involved. [https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1326482404224229376](https://twitter.com/openoms/status/1326482404224229376)

## logs

Monitor the pool logs in: `/home/pool/.pool/logs/mainnet/poold.log`

Example:

```text
tail -f -n 1000 /home/pool/.pool/logs/mainnet/poold.log
```
